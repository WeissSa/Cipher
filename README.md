# Cipher
Cipher made in Godot that can code and decode different ciphers.

Currently it is set to use any key (up to 26) for the Caesar Cipher and translate in and out of the Monoalphabetic Cipher given a key of 27 letters. 

Development will likely be irregular due to school and working on my game at the same time.
