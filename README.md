# Cypher
Cypher made in Godot that can code and decode different ciphers.

Currently it is set to use any key (up to 26) for the Caesar Cipher.

Will add other Ciphers in future and the ability to decode without key.

Development will likely be irregular due to school and working on my game at the same time.
